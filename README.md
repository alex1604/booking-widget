# Booking widget sample

This booking-widget is build as a React app running in conjunction with a local node.js / express.js server acting as an API

To correctly run the widget, follow these steps ( I assume you have already the package manager 'npm' installed as well as node.js installed as a global dependency )

#1
Open a terminal/bash window on the folder where the project is saved.

#2
Run **npm install**               // this will install all the necessary dependencies to run the project


#3
Run **node server.js**            // this will run a local server on the port 3000 (make sure the server runs on port                                                       3000 or it won't work ! )

#4
Open a new terminal/bash window on the folder
and run **npm run start**                       // this will run the React app on any free port (usually 3001)

(if asked if you want to run the app on a port
other than port 3000 type **y** and then 
enter)

#5
Play around with my booking widget.
